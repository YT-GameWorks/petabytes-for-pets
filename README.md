### petabytes-for-pets
Making a petabytes' worth of code to raise awareness for pet abuse.
# How does this help?
We're making a petabyte's worth of code on GitHub. That's got to catch people's attention. Our code is going to have code that serves some purpose to preventing animal abuse.
Animal abuse ain't cool, and thus, we need to get the attention of people to stop it. This is probably one of the craziest ideas out there, but crazy is my middle name.
If we can raise awareness that pet and animal abuse isn't cool, maybe the animals can live just as a great life as we do.
